# üõ°Ô∏è Mitigation Strategies for IoT Cybersecurity

## 1. Transport Layer Security (TLS)
- Enables encrypted communication between devices
- Protects against data interception and tampering

## 2. Secure Boot Processes
- Ensures devices only run trusted firmware during startup
- Prevents unauthorized firmware modifications

## 3. Lightweight Cryptography
- Optimized for resource-constrained IoT devices
- Provides strong encryption without heavy performance overhead

## 4. Network Segmentation
- Reduces attack surface by isolating IoT devices from critical systems

## 5. Regular Firmware Updates
- Addresses known vulnerabilities
- Ensures devices are protected against emerging threats

## 6. AI-Powered Threat Detection
- Uses machine learning to detect anomalous device behavior in real time
